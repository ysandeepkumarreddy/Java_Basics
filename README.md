This Repository is created for practice purpose who are new to Java

## What is Java?
Java is a programming language, designed to be concurrent, class-based and object-oriented, as well as a computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. An enormous amount of applications and websites will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.

## Benefits of Java over other programming languages
Java is a high level programming language and computing platform developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Since then, the language has been regularly updated with Java SE 8.0 version being the latest version, released in March 2014.

Based on the advantages of Java, it gained wide popularity and multiple configurations have been built to suit various types of platforms including Java SE for Macintosh, Windows and UNIX, Java ME for Mobile Applications and Java EE for Enterprise Applications.

With the growing importance of web based and mobile based applications, Java today is the foundation for most networked applications and is considered to be useful for scripting, web-based content, enterprise software, games and mobile applications.

## Applications of Java
Every enterprise uses Java in one way or other. As per Oracle, more than 3 billion devices run applications designed on the development platform. Java is used to design the following applications:
<ul>
<li>Desktop GUI applications</li>
<li>Embedded systems</li>
<li>Web applications, including eCommerce applications, front and back office electronic trading systems, settlement and confirmation systems, data processing projects, and more</li>
<li>Web servers and application servers</li>
<li>Mobile applications including Android applications</li>
<li>Enterprise applications</li>
<li>Scientific applications</li>
<li>Middleware products</li>
  </ul>

## Advantages of Java

  <ul>
      <li>
        Java offers higher cross- functionality and portability as programs
        written in one platform can run across desktops, mobiles, embedded
        systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java is free, simple, object-oriented, distributed, supports
        multithreading and offers multimedia and network support.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java is a mature language, therefore more stable and predictable. The
        Java Class Library enables cross-platform development.
      </li>
      <li>
        Being highly popular at enterprise, embedded and network level, Java has
        a large active user community and support available.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unlike C and C++, Java programs are compiled independent of platform in
        bytecode language which allows the same program to run on any machine
        that has a JVM installed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Java has powerful development tools like Eclipse SDK and NetBeans which
        have debugging capability and offer integrated development environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increasing language diversity, evidenced by compatibility of Java with
        Scala, Groovy, JRuby, and Clojure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Relatively seamless forward compatibility from one version to the next
      </li>
    </ul>
    
>  In conclusion, almost 20 years after its inception, Java continues to deliver considerable value to the world of software development. Java 8, in fact, offers new features such as a scalable and flexible platform for the Internet of Things, less boilerplate code, new date and time library and API, refreshed graphics toolkit, integration with JavaScript, and others.
